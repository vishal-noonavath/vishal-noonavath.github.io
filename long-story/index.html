                <p>This is the story of a paper boat. Folded from a scrap of forgotten thoughts, it sets sail on a
                    journey no one asked it to take.</p>

                <p>It sails down a small stream with a swift current. The boat dances between rocks, weaves between
                    aquatic vegetation, and ducks under branches finding a rhythm in the
                    uncertain.</p>

                <p>Soon, dark clouds start to gather. Rain pierces through the path and the boat begins to unravel. But
                    still, it floats onward.</p>

                <p>Suddenly, everything opens up. The stream spills into an ocean. The boat is small and there is no
                    longer a path. But now it knows how
                    to ride any wave.</p>
