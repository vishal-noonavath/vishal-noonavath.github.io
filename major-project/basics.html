                <p>
                    I am a senior at Washington State University majoring in Digital Technology and Communications (DTC),
                    specializing in the Web Development track. My academic focus has allowed me to explore the balance
                    between design, technology, and user experience while building meaningful digital projects.

            <h2>Interests & Balance</h2>
            <p>
                Outside of web development, I enjoy playing and watching high-paced sports such as football and basketball.
                At the same time, I find myself equally drawn to the serenity of art and nature. Bonsai sits perfectly
                between these interests, combining structure, discipline, creativity, and calm.

            <h2>What Bonsai Has Taught Me</h2>
            <p>
                Caring for bonsai has taught me patience, nurturing, planning, and adaptation. Each tree responds
                differently to care, and progress cannot be rushed. Over time, I learned that thoughtful observation
                and consistency matter more than quick results.
            </p>

            <p>
                There were moments when I ambitiously purchased trees simply because they looked impressive in nurseries
                or online photos. I soon realized that first impressions can be misleading. Each tree has unique needs,
                and overindulgence without understanding can lead to poor outcomes. Bonsai taught me to slow down,
                research, and commit intentionally.

            <h2>Purpose of This Website</h2>
            <p>
                This website was created to showcase my growing skills in web development alongside my early journey
                into bonsai cultivation. It reflects both my technical education and a personal practice that continues
                to shape how I approach learning, creativity, and long-term growth.
