    <h2>Using Images in HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>
        Images can be displayed on webpages either directly in the HTML using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag or by
        setting them as "backgrounds" through CSS using the <code>background-image</code> property. Each method serves
        different purposes in terms of visual design and code structure design.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML vs. CSS Image Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is used to insert an image directly into the HTML content. It is part of the
        document structure and can include attributes like <code>src</code>, <code>alt</code>, and <code>width</code>.
        For example:
    </p>

    <code>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Example image"&gt;</code>
    <br>
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/6c/bb/36/6cbb36a34afe45944dc1280aed5f9c0c.jpg" alt="Example image">

    <p>
        In contrast, <code>background-image</code> is used in CSS to apply an image as a decorative or background
        element. It does not appear in the HTML structure and cannot use attributes like <code>alt</code>, making it
        less accessible for screen readers. For example:
    </p>

    <code>background-image: url('image.jpg');</code>
    <div class="image-example"></div>

    <p>
        HTML images are ideal for content-related visuals like product photos or infographics, while background images
        are used for design purposes like banners. In both examples, the output is essentially the same, however, the
        background image doesn't contain an <code>alt</code> attribute. It would be better to use an html image in this
        particular case since it increases accessibility should the image not load. There would be no indication of a
        missing image if the background image didn't load.
    </p>

    <h2>CSS Properties for Background Images</h2>
    <p>
        Beyond <code>background-image</code>, there are several CSS properties to control how background images appear
        on the webpage. Two common ones are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>background-size</strong> - This determines how a background image is scaled within its container.
            Example: <code>background-size: cover;</code> makes the image cover the entire element area.
        </li>
        <li><strong>background-position</strong> - Defines where the image is placed inside the element.
            Example: <code>background-position: center;</code> centers the image in the element.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Dimensions vs. Resolution</h2>
    <p>
        Dimensions refer to an image’s physical width and height in pixels, while resolution describes the image’s level
        of detail, typically measured in pixels per inch or dots per inch (PPI or DPI). DPI/PPI matter for print but on
        the web, what matters most is pixel dimensions.
    </p>

    <h2>Image File Formats</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>GIF</strong> supports animation and transparency but is limited to 256 colors, making it best for simple
        graphics or logos.<br>
        <strong>PNG</strong> offers lossless compression and transparency, ideal for high-quality web graphics.<br>
        <strong>JPG/JPEG</strong> uses lossy compression, reducing file size but potentially lowering quality; it’s best
        for photographs.<br>
        <strong>WebP</strong> combines quality and compression efficiency, providing smaller file sizes with strong
        visual quality.<br>
        <strong>SVG</strong> is vector-based, meaning it scales without losing quality, making it ideal for icons and
        logos.
