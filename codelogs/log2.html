    <h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>
    <p>
    <h2>Difference between absolute and relative CSS length units</h2>
    <p>
        Absolute length units have fixed values, so a length defined with them will always appear at that exact size on
        whichever screen you are viewing off of. They are not always ideal since display sizes can vary greatly, (like
        phones vs. monitor screens vs. iPads vs.
        smart watches) but they work well when the output medium
        is known, such as in print layouts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Relative length units, on the other hand, are defined in relation to another length property. They adapt more
        effectively across different devices and rendering environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples:</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>px, pt</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A px (pixel) is a relative unit based on the resolution of the viewing device. It represents a single
                dot on the screen, but because screens vary in density, the actual size of a pixel may differ between
                devices. A pt (point) is an absolute unit traditionally used in print design, where 1 pt equals 1/72 of
                an inch. While points are consistent in print, their appearance can vary on screens.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>em, rem</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Both em and rem are relative units tied to font size. One em equals the font size of the element it is
                used in, so it scales relative to its parent’s size. This can cause compounding effects if multiple
                nested elements use em. A rem (root em), by contrast, always refers to the font size of the root
                element, ensuring more consistent scaling throughout a page.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>cap, ex, ch</li>
        <ul>
            <li>These units are based on typography rather than the screen or viewport. cap measures the height of
                capital letters in a font. ex measures the height of lowercase letters, specifically the letter "x,"
                which often defines the font’s x-height. ch is based on the width of the "0" character (zero) in the
                chosen font. These units are great for layouts where text alignment and readability are the focus, since
                they scale with the font itself.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
