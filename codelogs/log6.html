    <h2>What I Looked Up</h2>
    <p>
        I researched the CSS layout system <strong>Flexbox</strong>. I focused on how flex containers and flex items
        behave, the main properties for alignment and distribution, and common use cases for responsive layouts.
    </p>

    <h2>Resources I Consulted</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox"
                target="_blank">
                MDN Web Docs - Basic concepts of Flexbox
            </a>

            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp" target="_blank">

            </a>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Differences In The Information Presented</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>MDN</strong> gives a comprehensive and technical explanation. It explains axes, sizing rules,
            wrapping, and how Flexbox interacts with other layout systems. It also includes browser compatibility notes
            and links to deeper references.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>CSS-Tricks</strong> It lists every Flexbox property with short examples and clear visual diagrams.
            It is very useful when you want a quick reference. However, it is not interactive as it doesn't have ways to
            test
            out the code as do the other websites.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>W3Schools</strong> presents simple definitions and live examples. It is beginner friendly and good
            for quick experiments but it does not go as deep into edge cases.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>freeCodeCamp</strong> offers a concise cheatsheet and examples that highlight common patterns. It is
            great for learners who want a fast summary and common layouts to copy and adapt.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What features a good code reference page should offer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear definitions of each property with short, focused examples.</li>
        <li>Visual diagrams that show how axes and alignment work.</li>
        <li>Small interactive or live demos to experiment with values in place.</li>
        <li>Notes on browser support and common gotchas.</li>
        <li>A quick cheatsheet for common patterns and layout recipes.</li>
        <li>Links to deeper documentation and related layout systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Which resources stand out</h2>
    <p>
        MDN stands out for its extensive depth. It is the best single source when you need a complete technical
        explanation. It also has a "Try-it-yourself" feature where you can mess with the HTML/CSS/JavaScript like
        W3Schools does but the website looks more aesthetically pleasing so I would personally prefer it over the
        others. FreeCodeCamp and CSS-Tricks are similarly comprehensive but it doesn't have the interactive features of
        MDN which would've helped make them stand out more.
