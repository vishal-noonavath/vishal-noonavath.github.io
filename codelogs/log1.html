	<h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>
               <p>
                    Semantic tags are essentially just tags whose literal name mean what the tag is used for. They help differentiate between the types of visual content on the webpage. It seems like you could, hypothetically, code an entire website with minimal use of semantic tags but that would be a CSS coding nightmare. Types of semantic tags are header, footer, and section. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Non-Semantic tags are generic tags whose names don't convey the specific meaning or usage of their content. From my search, it seems that the div and span tags are the only widely used non-semantic tags. 
               </p>

            <h2>What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>
               <p>
                    Some benefits of using semantics tags are search engine optimization, accessibility, and browser compatibility. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Websites carefully designed with semantic tags increase its rankings in search engines because the algorithm they use parse through these tags to decipher content. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    For users who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers, semantic tags improve accessiblity as they are able interpret the meaning and structure of web pages better with these tags.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you use clear, meaningful semantics tags when building your website, it will work well with future technologies and standards, so you won't have to make big changes or fixes later. This way, even viewing these websites on different devices with varying screen sizes will not affect the structure and display as much.
